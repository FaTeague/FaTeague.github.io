                <div class="tab">
                    <p>
                        I supported the DoD and Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security’s (USD(I&S)) Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team (AWCFT) 
                        in the Apollo Program by analyzing and labeling imagery for a computer vision and machine learning initiative. Objects were identified and labeled with a high 
                        level of precision based upon a defined ontology. Outputs were used to train, test, and evaluate computer vision algorithms. I was selected to a team of 
                        approximately 40 analysts out of 200 which worked on a special labeling effort. This team required developing expertise in specific imagery types not in the 
                        program’s main line effort. Additionally, I trained and mentored new employees through collaboration. I am proficient on Full Motion Video, Infrared Images, Electrical Optics, 
                        High-Altitude Imagery, and Wide-area Motion Imagery.

                <h2>Harris County Flood Control District - Houston, Texas, United States</h2>
                <h3><i>Infrastructure Repairs Inspector - October 2018 - January 2020</i></h3>
                <div class="tab">
                    <p>
                        I was responsible for providing inspection work in the Infrastructure Repairs Department for the Harris County Flood Control District. This inspection work required 
                        that I understood project plans and specifications and ensured contractor work followed those guidelines. I needed to document all progress for my project through photos 
                        and field notes. Photos were uploaded to a shared ArcGIS online Collector map. Additionally, I was responsible for keeping track of pay items and invoices for each project. 
                        These invoices were scrutinized for accuracy before contractor payment was released. Additional responsibilities included producing maps for 
                        dumpsite proposals which followed the HCFCD environmental guidelines and any special projects requested by HCFCD managers or engineers.

                <h3><i>Field Data Collector - September 2017 - October 2018</i></h3>
                <div class="tab">
                    <p>
                        I was responsible for collecting data on the outfall pipes and various other features throughout the Harris County channel system. 
                        The data included a photo, a description, and various other data fields within the table. The versioned layer was uploaded onto a Trimble Geo7x GPS unit and updated 
                        when I encountered the feature in the field. Collected data was then joined with data collected from the current watershed and shared with the GIS department. 
                        The GIS department then disseminated the updated features to their various map products within Flood Control. I was also responsible for making weekly maps and reports of 
                        current progress and any issues in the field. In addition to the weekly maps, I also made maps of any emergency repairs I encountered in the field. 
                        Some additional responsibilities included clipping aerial photos, geocoding addresses, and any special projects the GIS department requested.

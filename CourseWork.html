                                The purpose of this course was to explore the most prominent threats to the civil security of the United States from an intelligence perspective. The aim was 
		                        to teach the importance of geography to the intelligence process through the use both quantitative and qualitative spatial analysis. Moreover, the course was
		                        designed to teach the importance of human geography to these civil security issues. These issues included security at the US/Mexican border, international 
		                        terrorism, and organized crime.

                                The primary focus of this course was on remotely sensed data for geospatial applications. In this course, I developed my analytical workflow skills with 
		                        a variety of software packages including, ArcGIS 10.8, ArcGIS Pro 2.7, ArcGIS Online, eCognition, and Google Earth Engine.
                                These workflows included data acquisition from openly sourced repositories, image enhancement, automated extraction of remotely sensed data, and accuracy 
                                assessment. Additionally, this course developed my critical thinking skills through exploration of real-world problems and through consideration of the limitations
                                within the remote sensing instruments being used to solve those problems.

                                The primary focus of this course was to further develop GIS skills in the context of a geospatial intelligence professional. In this course, I continued using
                                ArcGIS 10.8, ArcGIS Pro 2.7, and ArcGIS Online, but I also gained experience using other software packages such as GeoDa, CARTO, and QGIS. Lessons covered in
                                this course included how GIS and GEOINT integrate, vector analysis using proximity and overlay operations, raster terrain analysis, data quality/standards, and 
                                recent developments in GIS such as space-time integration and web-GIS.

                                The primary focus of this course was to challenge students to think within the geospatial intelligence domain. Using the Structured Geospatial Analytical 
                                Method (SGAM), students were able to walk through two challenging case studies, the 2002 DC Sniper Case and the 2003 death of Assistant US Attorney Johnathan
                                Luna. Through the duration of the course, I walked through the different SGAM steps within both case studies using a variety of techniques. These techniques
                                included brainstorming, key assumption checks, quality information checks, and Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH). Output of these various steps/techniques
                                were data discovery/validation/management, visualizations, and final maps and reports.

                                The primary focus of this two-part capstone course was to synthesize the knowledge of the previous courses into one final student project. I was required to 
                                develop an analytic question pertaining to a real-world GEOINT problem. From there, deliverables included a grounding and exploration literature search, 
                                hypotheses/method assumptions & limitation presentation, evidence and analysis to my selected real-world problem, and finally a conclusion in the form of
                                a verbal presentation and a paper. I am presently in GEOG 594B and my analytic question is over nuclear power plants in Texas.
